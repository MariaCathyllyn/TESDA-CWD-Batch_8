                <h4>Maintaining Your Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic</h4>
                <p>Feeling worried, anxious, scared, angry, distressed or depressed are expected during this pandemic and lockdown period. People are social animals with most needing adequate social interaction to nurture and promote their mental and emotional health. With the lockdown, people are confined to their own spaces or homes with little to no social interaction.</p>
                <p>People who are most vulnerable to mental health conditions during the pandemic include those who already have pre-existing mentalillnesses, frontline medical workers, kids, teens, the unemployed, older people suffering from chronic diseases, men and women in abusive relationships, among others.</p>
                <h4>Coping up with Stress</h4>
                <p>People who are undergoing emotional stress should acknowledge the fact that what they are feeling is not uncommon and is but a natural reaction to the abnormal environment they are in.</p>

Examples of things that you can control are looking after yourself, practicing social distancing, learning a new hobby and relaxing.

                        <p>If you are working from home, try to follow your old schedule. Start work at the same time of the day as you did before. If you are unemployed, find something productive or enjoyable to do and create a routine around it. Set daily or weekly milestones.</p>
                        <p>Wake up and sleep at the same time of the day everyday. Eat meals and do chores at set times as well. If you are a student and practice distance learning, observe fixed study or review periods. If your suffer from a medical condition get in touch with your healthcare advisor on how you can continue with your treatment regimen, such as therapies and consultations from home.</p>

                        <p>Reduce your time updating yourself on the coronavirus, economy, politics as these tend to be negative and depressing. Limit yourself to once or twice a day reading or watching the news. </p>
                        <p>Only visit or follow established and credible media outfits or news sources such as government agencies, international health organizations, national or global news organizations. If you have kids in the house, give them reasonable Covid-19 information to keep them informed (such as importance of washing hands, physical distancing) but not to the point that they would feel worried or scared.</p>

                        <p>It is recommended that you talk to a live human being at least once a day.</p>
                        <p>Since a lot of people nowadays have more time in their hands than they used to take advantage of this by reconnecting with old friends, long last family and acquaintances. </p>
                        <p>Harness the power of technology and join online groups or organizations. It is okay to meet people in person as long as you observe physical distancing and wear face masks. Play online games with friends or host/participate in online parties. </p>

                    <h5>Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR Test)</h5><p>Looks for viral genetic material to determine active infection. One of the most reliable tests to date. However, a few days may pass before the virus starts replicating in the throat and nose. Swabs can also sometimes fail to pick up signs of active infection. This takes several days because samples are generally sent to centralized labs for analysis.</p>

In general, these tests aren't reliable enough fro individuals to act based on the results. However, antibody tests can provide good information about the rates of infection in a community, where errors in an individual resuly have les impact. These tests generally produce results in a few minutes, based on a drop of blood taken from the finger.</p>
